Contributing to VOC
=======================


If you experience problems with VOC, `log them on GitHub`_. If you want to contribute code, please `fork the code`_ and `submit a pull request`_.

Setting up your development environment
---------------------------------------

The process of setting up a development environment is very similar to
the :doc:`/intro/getting-started` process. The biggest difference is that
instead of using the official PyBee repository, you'll be using your own
Github fork.

As with the getting started guide, these instructions will assume that you
have Python3, a Java 7 or Java 8 JDK, and Apache ANT installed, and have virtualenv available for use.

**Note:** If you are on Ubuntu, you will need to install ``libpython3.4-testsuite`` to be able to run the test suite.
This can be done by running ``apt-get install libpython3.4-testsuite``.

Start by forking VOC into your own Github repository; then
check out your fork to your own computer into a development directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir voc-dev
    $ cd voc-dev
    $ git clone git@github.com:<your github username>/voc.git

Then create a virtual environment and install VOC into it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ virtualenv -p $(which python3) env
    $ . env/bin/activate
    $ cd voc
    $ pip install -e .

You're now ready to run the test suite!

Running the test suite
----------------------

To run the entire test suite, type:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py test

To capture unexpected successes in test:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py test | grep success

Running the full test suite will take quite a while - it takes 40 minutes on the CI server. You can speed this up by running the tests in parallel via pytest:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements/tests.txt
    $ py.test -n auto

You can specify the number of cores to utilize, or use ``auto`` as shown above to use all available cores.

If you just want to run a single test, or a single group of tests, you can provide command-line arguments.

To run a single test, provide the full dotted-path to the test:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py test -s tests.datatypes.test_str.BinaryStrOperationTests.test_add_bool

To run a full test case, do the same, but stop at the test case name:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py test -s tests.datatypes.test_str.BinaryStrOperationTests

Or, to run all the Str datatype tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py test -s tests.datatypes.test_str

Or, to run all the datatypes tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py test -s tests.datatypes
